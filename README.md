# visitor_counter_simple_html
This project is a people counter using an ESP8266, PIR sensors, an LCD (I2C) screen, and Firebase Realtime Database. The system tracks the number of people entering and exiting a room and updates this information both on an LCD display and in a Firebase database. A simple HTML page is provided to display live visitor data via a browser.
